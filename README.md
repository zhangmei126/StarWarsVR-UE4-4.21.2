# StarWarsVR-UE4-4.21
VR Star Wars Game

This is a free fan made game produced within Unreal Engine 4. The models/textures come from many sources, but the majority
of them come from DICE's Star Wars Battlefront 2 (2017). All characters, locations, and objects are subject to the terms of fair
use and are the property of The Walt Disney Company and LucasArts.

This is a passion project and currently being worked on by one person. Anyone with proficiency in UE4 that wishes to assist in development
can feel free to contact me via GitHub. As I am the only dev as of right now, please do let me know about any bugs/issues via GitHub. 

Have fun!
